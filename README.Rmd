Just an example of how to use the `defmacro` package.

## Example

The package exports a function called `analyze_dataset` with the following code that defines its own pipe function.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
analyze_dataset <- function(data) {
  pipe({
    data
    dplyr::filter(hp > constexpr(50 + 50 + qnorm(0.975)))
    dplyr::group_by(cyl)
    dplyr::summarise(dplyr::n())
  })
}

```

During package load, the code gets replaced by the expanded version of the macro. This means the function does not have any runtime overhead.

```{r}
defmacroex::analyze_dataset
```
